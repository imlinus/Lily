# Lily.js

This is just my Hobby UI framework, not done by a long shot :P
I'm just trying to combine (what I think is) the best parts from Vue and React and make it in to a "true" WebComponents based framework (so mostly a webcomponents wrapper with two-way bindings through proxy :-D)

Right now I'm trying to get my head around `WebComponents` & `Proxy`

Check the [/docs](https://github.com/imlinus/lily/tree/master/docs) directory for a "working" example

Wanna try it out?

Install CLI tool
```
$ npm i -g lily-cli
```

Then download a seed project (boilerplate)
```
$ lily my-app
```

Cheers
